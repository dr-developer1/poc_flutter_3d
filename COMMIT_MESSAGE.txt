feat: complete solar system explorer with dual view modes and animations

Implemented a comprehensive Flutter-based solar system explorer application with
3D model viewing, animated orbital view, comparison mode, and extensive educational features.

Features Implemented:
======================

âœ¨ Core Features:
- 3D model viewer with GLB support for all celestial bodies (Sun, 8 planets, Moon, 5 asteroids)
- 2D orbital animation view with real-time planetary motion
- Dual view mode switching (3D Model â†” Orbital View)
- Interactive planet selection via tap or horizontal selector
- Search functionality for quick planet discovery
- Side-by-side planet comparison mode

ðŸŽ® Interactive Controls:
- Time control system (1x - 100x speed with play/pause)
- Quick speed preset buttons (1x, 10x, 50x, 100x)
- Touch interactions for planet selection in both view modes
- 3D model rotation and zoom via gestures

ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements:
- Space-themed dark gradient backgrounds
- Color-coded celestial bodies (each with characteristic color)
- Glowing selection effects for active planets
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Smooth animated transitions between views
- Background star field in orbital view
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

ðŸ“Š Educational Content:
- 38+ interesting facts across all celestial bodies
- Scientifically accurate data (sizes, distances, orbital speeds)
- Visual size comparison bars in comparison mode
- Statistics table with AU distances and km/s speeds
- Comprehensive information cards with scrollable content

Technical Implementation:
=========================

Architecture:
- Clean separation of concerns (Models, Data, Screens, Widgets)
- Repository pattern for centralized data management
- Immutable data models with const constructors
- Component-based widget architecture
- StatefulWidget for stateful components

Key Components:
- CelestialBody model with proper equality and type safety
- SolarSystemData repository with 15 celestial bodies
- CelestialBody3DWidget for reusable 3D viewing
- OrbitalSystemView with CustomPainter for efficient 2D rendering
- TimeControlWidget for animation control
- ComparisonScreen for side-by-side analysis

Animation System:
- AnimationController with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin
- Real-time orbital calculations based on actual speeds
- Dynamic time scaling (1x to 100x) with non-linear slider
- Continuous motion with repeat mode
- Pause/play functionality

Code Quality:
- Full null safety support throughout
- Comprehensive dartdoc comments
- Fixed 44 deprecation warnings (.withOpacity â†’ .withValues)
- Proper lifecycle management (initState, dispose)
- Error handling with user feedback via SnackBars

Platform Configuration:
=======================

Android:
- INTERNET permission for 3D model loading via WebView
- Network security config allowing cleartext for localhost
- Proper AndroidManifest.xml configuration
- network_security_config.xml for flutter_3d_controller support
